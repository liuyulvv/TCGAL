# RCGAL

Rust Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

RCGAL is still in the early state of development, and the API is not stable yet.

RCGAL is **not** a Rust binding of [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), but a new library that is inspired by the CGAL.

The main goal of RCGAL now is to provide a set of basic 2D geometric algorithms. The documentation is still in progress.

## Features

-   2D geometric primitives: Vector2, Point2, LineSegment2, CircleSegment2, ArcSegment2, Triangle2, Polygon2, Line2, Ray2, etc.
-   2D geometric algorithms: Convex hull, Location, Intersection, Triangulation, etc.

## Documentation

The documentation is still in progress, but the experimental documentation is available at [rcgal_doc](https://liuyulvv.github.io/rcgal_doc/). We add an `Intersection` example in the [documentation](https://liuyulvv.github.io/rcgal_doc/example.html) using `wasm` with the help of [Konva](https://konvajs.org/index.html).
